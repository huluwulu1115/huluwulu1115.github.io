With no consistent metric for FLASH Parking to measure customer satisfaction, the 2023 FLASH MDP Cohort was tasked with developing an automated system to measure customer satisfaction. This system utilizes visual and audio data from parking kiosks.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into 3 major parts:

- **Object Detection Subteam**: Focuses on identifying human faces and extracting relevant audio snippets from video footage.
- **Visual Sentiment Subteam**: Focuses on classifying sentiment from images.
- **Audio Sentiment Subteam**: Focuses on classifying sentiment from audio.

We developed, trained, and tested various customer satisfaction assessment models. These models are integrated into automated software for efficient data processing and insight generation.

## Technical Details

The pipeline delivers:
- A sentiment tag (Positive or Negative)
- A multimodal sentiment score range [0, 1]

**Input formats supported:**
1. Self-recorded video clip
2. Real-time camera recording

The repository includes both the original code and detailed description of current works, as well as legacy models.

This project presents a complete robotic manipulation pipeline for a 7-DoF Franka Emika Panda arm performing dynamic pick-and-place. By integrating AprilTag-based vision, motion planning, and impedance control within a ROS–Gazebo framework, the system autonomously grasped and stacked both static and rotating dynamic cubes with high precision. Its consistent real-time performance in hardware trials earned 🥇 1st place with a 🏆 record 28,000 points (next best 8,500).

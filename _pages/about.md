I'm a second-year Robotics M.S.E. student in the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Prof. [Antonio Loquercio](https://antonilo.github.io/) and Prof.[Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/). 

Previously, I received a B.S. in Computer Science, Data Science, and Linguistics from the University of Michigan, where I worked with Prof. [Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/).

I enjoy exploring new ideas, and that curiosity shapes my research. At the University of Michigan, I explored how semantic knowledge can guide robot planning and policy. At Penn, I focus more on **physics-grounded robot learning** for manipulation and humanoid control.

Outside the lab it‚Äôs sim2real for me: ‚õ∞Ô∏ètrails, üéæcourts, and üéûÔ∏è35mm frames.

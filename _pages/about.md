I'm a second-year Robotics M.S.E. student in the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Profs. [Antonio Loquercio](https://antonilo.github.io/) and [Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/). Previously, I received a B.S. in Computer Science, Data Science, and Linguistics from the University of Michigan, where I worked with Prof. [Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/).

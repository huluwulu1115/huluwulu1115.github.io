  title={RoSHI: A Versatile Robot-oriented Suit for Human Data In-the-Wild},
  author={Wenjing Mao and Jefferson Ng and Luyang Hu and Antonio Loquercio},
  journal={ICRA 2026(under review)},
  year={2025},
  abstract={We present RoSHI, a low-cost wearable that fuses nine IMUs with Meta's Aria glasses to capture full-body motion, articulated hands, and egocentric video. Our design emphasizes long-horizon stability and occlusion robustness for humanoid learning. We introduce a simulation-in-the-loop retargeting framework that converts human data into physically feasible robot actions. 61.9% of captured sequences successfully deployed on a Unitree G1 humanoid, providing a scalable foundation for human-to-humanoid imitation learning.},

  title={EUREKAWORLD: Scalable Real-World Manipulation via LLM-Automated RL},
  author={Luyang Hu and others and Dinesh Jayaraman and Osbert Bastani},
  year={2025},
  abstract={We present Eureka for Manipulation, a large-scale RL framework that integrates LLMs to automate environment setup, reward shaping, and curriculum design for dexterous manipulation. Leveraging hundreds of GPUs, our system couples LLM-guided simulation construction with massive RL optimization to generate diverse digital twins and achieve zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. We demonstrate robust transfer across manipulation tasks from single-arm tool use to bimanual coordination, and propose a sim2sim2real benchmark for scalable reproducibility.},
